<!-- User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user. -->

      <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
      <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
      <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:</p>
      <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>

    <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
      <li>The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
      <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

    <article>
      <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
      <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
      <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the p.</p>
      <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
      <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</strong></code>
      <p>The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
    <header>Variable scope</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
        function.
      </p>

      <p>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
        global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
        is an if statement.
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code
        >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
        defined</code
      >

  <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
    <header>Global variables</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
        pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
        variables using the window.variable syntax.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
        frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
        name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
        document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
        parent.phoneNumber.
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
    <header>Constants</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
      </p>

      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
      <p>
        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
        represent a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
        variable in the same scope. For example:
      </p>

      <code
        >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
        CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
        }</code
      >
      However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
      is executed without problems.
      <code
        >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code

  <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
    <header>Data types</header>
    <article>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>
              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
              other variant.
            </li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>
              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
              unique and immutable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
      to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
      are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
      objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
      your application can perform.

  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
    <header>if...else statement</header>
    <article>
      Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
      true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
      is false. An if statement looks as follows:

      <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
      condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
      statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
      including further nested if statements.
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <code
        >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
      </code>
      In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
      evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
      them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
      to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

      <code
        >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
      >
      It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
      because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
      the code. For example, do not use the following code:
      <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
      assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
      additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

      <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <article>
      A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
      evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

      <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
      statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
      statement following the loop.

      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>

      <p>
        To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
        those statements.
      </p>

      Example:

      <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
        true, so the loop terminates.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
    <header>Function declarations</header>
    <article>
      A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
      statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

      <ul>
        <li>The name of the function.</li>
        <li>
          A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
          separated by commas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
          brackets, { }.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
      </p>

      <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
      <p>
        The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
        consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
        function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
        specifies the value returned by the function.
      </p>
      <code>return number * number;</code>
      <p>
        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
        value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
        the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
        the calling function.
